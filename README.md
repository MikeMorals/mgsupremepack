my newly updated supremepack for megaglest 
the other repository bugged and was soft locked so i couldnt update it.
		FACTION EUROPE
no battlemachine or airship
guard towers are cheaper and weaker
the priest(technician) functions as a premium worker
its strong units for now are the greatsword and longbow, plan on buffing the horseman.
		FACTION TECH
stronger battlemachine
catapult replaced with slow motor firing only battlemachine
removed horseman
		FACTION INDIAN
firearcher and normal archer have little armor
archer does same damage as tech archer but cant be upgraded
the elite units are the thunder bird and fire golem
fire golem is tough as moving structure
behive given non friendly firing splash and given lower hp and regen, bc theyre bees and all
bigtent no longer takes stone and is built much faster
the spearman is the strongest unit in the game for his price point
		FACTION ROMANS
spearman nerfed to be an actual swarm unit
gladiator made to be a final form of the spearman, verry echonomical
made turtle formation really tough
		FACTION NORSEMEN
made swordman and battleaxe tougher
nerfed crossbow damage
nerfed axethrower damage
buffed valkyrie massively but still a little weak
massively buffed thor
gave spearman more armor and made him slower
		GENERAL FIXES
made all damage modifiers resist more, effectively making battles last longer and
bases take actual effort to destroy
heavily nerfed ranged units, you can no longer spam archer and win every game
you have to actually use STRATEGY no archer spam
egypt still needs more love
persia had many tweaks for units to be all around more usefull but still
need to fix up persia and egypt. i did add aztec but they are currently just
to boring to play
